## IoTThings ServiceIDE

IoTThings ServiceIDE is a graphical Integrated Development Environment for designing, managing, and executing IoT applications in smart space environments. The system automatically discovers IoT devices, their internal components, and the services they expose through multicast network communication, maintaining an up-to-date view of the available resources.

The IDE allows users to visually compose IoT applications by connecting services through logical relationships such as ordered, conditional, or success-based execution. Applications are created using a drag-and-drop graphical editor, configured through dedicated panels, and executed directly within the platform with real-time monitoring support. Projects are saved in a portable JSON-based format, enabling reuse and easy management.

Thanks to its modular architecture and visual approach, IoTThings ServiceIDE simplifies the orchestration of complex workflows across heterogeneous IoT devices while remaining extensible for future enhancements.
